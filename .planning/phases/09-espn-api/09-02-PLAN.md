<objective>
Add women's basketball scoreboard to homepage

Purpose: The UAT revealed that women's basketball is missing from the homepage despite the ESPN library fully supporting it. This gap closure adds women's basketball game data fetching and rendering.

Output: Homepage displays both men's and women's basketball scoreboards in the basketball section.

  <name>Task 1: Add women's basketball game fetch and render</name>
  <files>frontend/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Modify `frontend/app/page.tsx` to add women's basketball support:

1. Add state variable for women's basketball game:
   - Add `let womensBasketballGame: SimpleGame | null = null;` after mensBasketballGame declaration

2. Add fetch for women's basketball (in parallel with men's or separately):
   - Add try/catch block to fetch `getClemsonGameById("womensBasketball", "latest")`
   - Assign result to `womensBasketballGame`

3. Update the basketball section render to show both games:
   - In the `isBasketball` conditional, render TWO GameScoreWidget components:
     - First: men's basketball (existing)
     - Second: women's basketball (new)
   - Wrap both in a container div with appropriate spacing
   - Each GameScoreWidget should only render if its game data exists (conditional rendering)

Example structure for the basketball section:
```tsx
{isBasketball && (mensBasketballGame || womensBasketballGame) && (
  <div className="mb-8 space-y-4">
    {mensBasketballGame && (
      <GameScoreWidget
        sport="mensBasketball"
        initialGame={mensBasketballGame}
        postGameDuration={30}
      />
    )}
    {womensBasketballGame && (
      <GameScoreWidget
        sport="womensBasketball"
        initialGame={womensBasketballGame}
        postGameDuration={30}
      />
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

Note: The ESPN library already supports "womensBasketball" as a valid SportType - no changes needed to espn.ts.

  <verify>
Run `npm run build` in frontend directory - should compile without errors.
Run `npm run dev` and verify homepage loads with basketball section showing women's basketball widget (if a game exists).
  </verify>
  <done>
Homepage fetches and displays women's basketball game data alongside men's basketball in the basketball section. Both widgets render conditionally based on game availability.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without TypeScript errors
- [ ] Homepage loads without runtime errors
- [ ] Basketball section shows women's basketball GameScoreWidget when game data exists
- [ ] Men's basketball still displays correctly (no regression)
- [ ] Both widgets have proper spacing and layout
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Women's basketball scorecard appears on homepage in basketball section
- Both men's and women's basketball games are fetched from ESPN API
- Layout handles cases where one or both games may not have data
- No regressions to existing men's basketball functionality
</success_criteria>
