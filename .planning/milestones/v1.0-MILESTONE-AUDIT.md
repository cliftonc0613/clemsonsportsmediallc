## Tech Debt (Low Priority)

These items are non-blocking and can be addressed in future iterations:

1. **StoryBrand components** - 9 unused template files
   - Location: `/components/storybrand/`
   - Recommendation: Archive or remove if not needed

2. **Visual breadcrumbs** - Schema exists, UI component missing
   - Impact: Minor UX improvement
   - Current workaround: Navigation via header and category badges

3. **Tag navigation** - Tag pages exist but not prominent in header
   - Impact: Low (tags accessible via post metadata)
   - Recommendation: Add dropdown if tag taxonomy becomes important

4. **Hardcoded sport categories** - Could fetch dynamically from WordPress
   - Current approach: Faster, acceptable for fixed sports structure
   - Future: Dynamic if sports list changes frequently

## Build Status

```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ 158 routes generated
✓ Static/SSG/Dynamic routing working
✓ Service worker generated
```

### Minor Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Future roster data (expected)
- Dynamic server usage on homepage (intentional for fresh content)
- Large ESPN standings cache (functions correctly)

## Production Readiness

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

All milestone requirements met:
- ✅ 9/9 phases complete
- ✅ All critical user flows working
- ✅ WordPress + ESPN APIs integrated
- ✅ PWA functionality complete
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Design system consistent

## Recommendations

### Before Launch
None required - system is production-ready.

### Post-Launch Improvements
1. Add visual breadcrumbs to blog posts
2. Create Tags navigation dropdown
3. Monitor ESPN API during live games
4. Consider cleanup of StoryBrand templates

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.0 has achieved its definition of done. The Clemson Sports Media platform is a cohesive, well-integrated sports news website with:

- Modern newspaper-style design with Clemson branding
- WordPress-powered content management
- ESPN live scores and schedules
- PWA capabilities for mobile users
- Excellent performance foundations

**Recommendation:** Proceed to `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.0` to archive and tag this release.
